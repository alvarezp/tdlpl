TDLPL
=====

Test-Driven Learning Programming Languages is a set of programming challenges
for people that already know programming but want to learn a new language.

How to use
==========

Clone the repository with:

`git clone https://github.com/alvarezp/tdlpl.git`

Make sure you GNU Make is installed, then just run

`make`

You might need to run `gmake` on non-GNU or non-Linux systems.

Current state
=============

At this state the project only has basic start challenges. More should come
in a few months... sooner if you help me out!

Enjoy!
