Welcome to TDLPL: Test-Driven Learning Programming Languages.

You will be presented with challenges that you should solve in the programming
language of your choice. After you attempt to solve the challenge, issue 'make
progress' (or just 'make') to continue.

To start you must configure TDLPL. You will find a set of sample configuration
files under the directory config-samples. Choose the one of your preference and
copy it to the current directory under the name 'configuration'. Consider this
to be your first challenge.

Also, please keep in mind that 'make' will keep showing an 'Error: 1' message.
It means that you have not completed the full set of challenges.

Good luck!
