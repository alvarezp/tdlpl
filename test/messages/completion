CONGRATULATIONS! You have reached the end of the TDLPL challenges!

Many thanks for using TDLPL. This is what we have so far. If you would like to
contribute to the project here are some hints:

To create a new challenge create a test under the test/ directory and add it
to the CHALLENGES variable to the GNUmakefile. Make sure you insert it in an
appropriate place according to the challenge difficulty.

To support a new programming language, edit the GNUmakefile to add the
corresponding rule that prepares the runnable file. The runnable file goes
into the run/ directory. Finally, create its sample configuration file under
config-samples/.
